##Writeup Template

###You can use this file as a template for your writeup if you want to submit it as a markdown file, but feel free to use some other method and submit a pdf if you prefer.

The Follwing things were performed in this project:-
    1.The Datasets of traffic Signs where downloaded and extracted to requisite place in  the directory.
    2.Then Data was load in the form of training,test and validation sets.
    3.In next step I counted number of examples and classes in the data sets along with number of shape of the training sets.
    4.In next step I loaded displayed some training data sets.
    5.Then I reshuffled the training sets data
    6.Created Lenet model archtecture consisting of convolution network,relu and maxpool and then flattening the layer.
    7.Then we used tensor flow to learn and check the accuracy of the leNet archtecture.
    8.After Validating with test sets.I downloaded some traffic sign pictures to check the accuracy on this images that comes out to be 93.33%
